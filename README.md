**Better Flight** aims to improve vanilla Elytra mechanics, making them more fun to use in a balanced way that reduces the need for firework rockets and gunpowder.


**Features:**
* Elytra Durability is shown on the HUD
* Easy take-off feature via sprint + double jump
* Flap your wings to gain altitude
* Flare your wings to slow down and land
* Fireworks are still useful for speed boosts and rapid ascent
* Flapping and flaring consume flight stamina, which recharges from your hunger bar
* Manage your flight stamina and hunger well, and you can fly until your Elytra's durability runs out!


**Controls (Rebindable):**
* While sprinting, tap space to jump, then tap space again while in the air to take off.
* While flying, tap space to flap your wings and gain a small boost of speed and altitude.
* While flying, hold X to flare your wings. This will slow you down rapidly and make landing easier.
* Press F10 to cycle between locations for the Flight Stamina Meter.


** Integrations & Configuration: **
* The mod should be compatible with most other Elytra mods out of the box.
* It is curio-aware, and support for additional Elytra items can be added in via the config file
* The mod is highly configurable, with food costs and most behaviors adjustable in a server-side config which is automatically synchronized to all players in the world.
* It is not required, but highly recommended to use AppleSkin or another mod that shows your saturation meter, to make managing the food cost more obvious.
